Known Problems
==============

By now this extension is not tested in production at all. Some things which are not implemented yet:

* The extension ONLY works with single domain sites, since the hostname is not added to the cache identifier
* I'm not sure if it works with page-cache-tags
* I don't know if clear-cache-configurations work
